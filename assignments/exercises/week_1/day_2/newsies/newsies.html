        <div class="newspaper">
            
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; text-indent: 4em;">I got this feeling inside my bones
            It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
            All through my city, all through my home
            We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone

            I got that sunshine in my pocket
            Got that good soul in my feet
            I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
            I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
            Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

            And under the lights when everything goes
            Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
            When we move, well, you already know
            So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
            Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
            Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
            So just dance, dance, dance, come on
            All those things I shouldn't do
            But you dance, dance, dance
            And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

            I can't stop the feeling
            So just dance, dance, dance
            I can't stop the feeling
            So just dance, dance, dance, come on

            Ooh, it's something magical
            It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
            Don't need no reason, don't need control
            I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

            'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
            Got that good soul in my feet
            I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
            I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
            Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

            And under the lights when everything goes
            Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
            When we move, well, you already know
            So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
            Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
            Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
            So just dance, dance, dance, come on
            All those things I shouldn't do
            But you dance, dance, dance
            And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

            I can't stop the feeling
            So just dance, dance, dance
            I can't stop the feeling
            So just dance, dance, dance
            I can't stop the feeling
            So just dance, dance, dance
            I can't stop the feeling
            So keep dancing, come on

            I can't stop the, I can't stop the
            I can't stop the, I can't stop the
            I can't stop the feeling

            Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
            So just dance, dance, dance, come on
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            All those things I shouldn't do
            But you dance, dance, dance
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

            Everybody sing
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            Got this feeling in my body
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            Got this feeling in my body
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            Wanna see you move your body
            (I can't stop the feeling)
            Got this feeling in my body
            Break it down
            Got this feeling in my body
            Can't stop the feeling
            Got this feeling in my body, come on</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; text-indent: 4em;">I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
            Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
            I know I could try looking for something new
            But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

            Some people lie but they're looking for magic
            Others are quietly going insane
            I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
            No easy love could ever make me feel the same

            I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
            Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
            I don't even try looking for something new
            Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

            Some people try but they can't find the magic
            Others get down on their knees and they pray
            I come alive when I’m close to the madness
            No easy love could ever make me feel the same
            Make me feel the same
            Make me feel the same, same, same

            I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
            Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
            I know I could try looking for something new
            But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
            Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

            Some people pray to their God for some magic
            Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
            No easy love could ever make me feel the same
            Make me feel the same, same, same

            I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
            Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
            I know I could try looking for something new
            But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

            You think it's a lie when I'm telling the truth
            Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
            Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
            Looking for you, looking for you, ah</p>
